# Github Scraper
This application uses the github api to scrape github data such as issues and commits. This data can be saved and used at a later point as input into an auto grader application for github class projects.

## Usage
1. `make compile` will compile all of the java files
2. `make run` will start running the application
3. Once the application is running you must enter the repository name. For example this repository would be `CompassSoftware/GDET-Four-Musketeers`
4. You will be notified if the repository name is valid or not. If it is it will load in all of the issues and commits, if not it will notify you and exit.
5. If successful you will be able to select from a multitude of options. Type the number of the option you want to choose and press enter.
6. EXPLAIN ALL OF THE OPTIONS. Not sure what they are being reworked to.
